# Advent of Code 2023

This is my first year doing the advent of code! I'll be doing these in Python as it is the language I'm most comfortable with.

Durring these I will have GitHub Copilot disabled, and I won't be using ChatGPT or any other AI assistance. I'm allowing myself normal access to Google and forums however.
